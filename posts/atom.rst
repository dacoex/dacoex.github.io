Atom editor seems to be a very neat tool. For coding, especially.

But the I found out that it sends usage statistics to `Google Analytics <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(text_editor)#Google_Analytics>`_ by default.

The same way as Firefox is doing it (see: `Telemetry/FAQ - MozillaWiki <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Telemetry/FAQ>`_).

I removed the program for now since I have no time to checkif the opt out really works.

Maybe another day I will check the source code of this option can be removed completely by disabling the `Metrics package - Atom <https://atom.io/packages/metrics>`_.

But what I really find disappointing is that the data collection **is on by default and users are not informed**.
